# Uncovering Trends in Cancer Deaths by Country and Type:
- A data-driven analysis of global cancer mortality trends (1990–2019), exploring regional differences, top cancer burdens, and forecasting future risks to support healthcare policy and research

# Introduction
- Cancer remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, but its impact varies significantly across countries, regions, and cancer types. Understanding these variations is critical for shaping healthcare policy, allocating resources, and developing prevention and treatment strategies.
- This project analyzes global cancer mortality data (1990–2019), covering 29 cancer types across multiple countries. By exploring trends, patterns, and risk factors, this project aims to provide actionable insights into how cancer affects populations differently and identify opportunities for targeted interventions.

# Problem Statement
- Cancer mortality varies significantly across the globe. Without proper analysis, it is difficult for policymakers and researchers to know which cancer types are rising, where interventions are most needed, and which regions face disproportionate burdens.
- This project seeks to analyze and predict global cancer mortality trends in order to answer important healthcare questions, identify risk hotspots, and guide global health strategies.


# What does this project do?
- Analyzes global cancer mortality data (1990–2019) across 29 cancer types and multiple countries.
- Explores historical trends, regional differences, and cancer-specific burdens.
- Uses data visualization, statistical analysis, and predictive modeling to uncover insights and forecast future mortality rates.

# What problem does it solve?
- Cancer mortality varies greatly across regions and cancer types, making it difficult to prioritize interventions.
- Provides a data-driven framework to:
  - Track global and regional mortality trends
  - Identify the most lethal cancer types
  - Highlight high-burden regions and risk hotspots
  - Forecast future mortality to guide policy and healthcare strategies

# Who is it for?
- Healthcare policymakers : plan interventions and allocate resources effectively
- Researchers & public health experts : study global patterns and risk factors
- Nonprofits & NGOs : target regions and populations needing urgent support
- Data scientists & students : practice exploratory analysis, forecasting, clustering, and prediction with real-world health data
